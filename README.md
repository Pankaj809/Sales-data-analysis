Sales Data Analysis Project
This repository contains an Excel project that analyzes the sales data of a company to determine the most popular time for customers to make purchases. The project involves cleaning and formatting the data, and using Excel functions and charts to visualize the results. The project is designed to demonstrate basic data analysis skills and proficiency with Excel.

Getting Started
To use this project, simply download the sales_data.xlsx file and open it in Excel. The file contains a single worksheet with sales data for a period of one month. The data includes information about the date and time of each purchase, the product purchased, the price, and the payment method.

Cleaning and Formatting the Data
Before analyzing the data, we need to clean and format it. This involves removing any empty or irrelevant rows and columns, and separating the date and time into separate columns. We can use Excel functions such as LEFT, RIGHT, MID, and DATEVALUE to extract the relevant information from the date and time column.

Analyzing the Data
Once the data is cleaned and formatted, we can use Excel functions and charts to analyze it. In this project, we are interested in finding the most popular time for customers to make purchases. We can use a pivot table and a pivot chart to group the sales data by hour of the day and visualize the results.
